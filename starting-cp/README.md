## What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive Programming is a mind sport programming where participants are given a problem and have to solve the problem by making an efficient program under the given constraint. Usually, the program is made with programming languages such as C++, Java, or Python, but it depends on the contest and platform.

## Problem Example

Almost all competitive programming problems have the same format, it will have the problem name, problem description, the constraint of the problem, format input and output examples, explanation (not always), and also the time and memory limit for the program solution. Here is the problem example:

### **Pair of Tens!**

Time Limit: 1s

Memory Limit: 64MB

Given a list of n integer numbers, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Find the number of pairs in the list which adds up to 10

**Input**

The first line of input contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 1000), which is the number of integer in the list.

The second line contains n integers, the i-th of them is a_i (0 <= a_i <= 10), which is the value of the i-th integer in the list.

**Output**

Print a single line containing the number of pairs in the list which adds up to $10$.

**Examples**

Input:
```
5
3 7 2 8 8
```
Output:
```
3
```

Input:
```
4
5 5 5 5
```
Output:
```
6
```

**Explanation**

On the first example, there is 3 pair which adds up to 10, that is (3, 7), (2, 8), and also (2, 8). Note that numbers having the same value can be counted more than once.
